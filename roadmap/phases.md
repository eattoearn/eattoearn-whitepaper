# Phases

#### Phase 1 — Early Access (Live)

The foundation of Eat2Earn is established in this phase. Users can join the waitlist, access the Telegram Mini App, scan food bills, and start earning XP and points. Core validation systems, reward calculations, and early user tracking are implemented to ensure real-world participation and fairness.

This phase focuses on onboarding, system stability, and early community growth.

#### Phase 2 — Gamification & Initial Listing

Eat2Earn expands into a fully gamified experience. Daily quests, streaks, levels, badges, and leaderboards are introduced to encourage consistent engagement. The platform reaches a level of maturity where participation metrics, user activity, and reward logic are validated at scale.

During this phase, Eat2Earn targets **initial token listing readiness**, ensuring that any listing aligns with real usage, fair distribution, and long-term ecosystem health. Listings are approached carefully and transparently, prioritizing sustainability over short-term speculation.

#### Phase 3 — Rewards & Utility Expansion

Participation-based rewards unlock deeper utility. Points earned through real activity gain stronger influence, and early users begin transitioning toward long-term benefit realization. Advanced challenges, exclusive access, and expanded ecosystem utilities are introduced gradually.

This phase focuses on rewarding commitment and consistency rather than short-term activity.

#### Phase 4 — Ecosystem & Partnerships

Eat2Earn expands into a broader ecosystem through city-level competitions, brand collaborations, and sponsored challenges. Partnerships are introduced selectively to enhance user rewards without altering natural eating behavior.

Community-driven initiatives and advanced referral mechanics are rolled out carefully.

***

#### Phase 5 — Governance & Long-Term Evolution

As the ecosystem matures, Eat2Earn explores community participation in platform decision-making. Governance mechanisms may be introduced to allow long-term users to influence ecosystem direction, reward mechanics, and future initiatives.

This phase emphasizes transparency, decentralization, and durable ownership.

#### Roadmap Philosophy

Eat2Earn follows a readiness-based roadmap rather than fixed dates. Features and milestones are released only when quality, security, and sustainability benchmarks are met. This approach protects users and ensures long-term ecosystem value.
