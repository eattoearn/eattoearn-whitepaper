# What is Eat2Earn

**Eat2Earn** is a real-world rewards and gamification platform that enables users to earn points, experience (XP), and future token-based benefits simply by **eating food and scanning their bills**.

The platform is built to reward **real-life behavior**, not online clicks, ads, or speculative actions.

Users continue eating exactly the way they always have.\
Eat2Earn adds a reward layer on top of an existing daily habit.

### The Core Idea

People spend money on food every day, but that spending produces **no long-term value** for the consumer.

Eat2Earn changes this by converting food consumption into:

* Rewards
* Progress
* Status
* Ownership (in later stages)

Instead of asking users to change behavior, Eat2Earn **rewards behavior that already exists**.
