# Introduction

Eat2Earn is a real-world rewards and gamification platform designed to convert everyday food consumption into measurable value. By scanning food bills through a Telegram Mini App, users earn points, experience (XP), and long-term participation benefits without changing their eating habits or learning complex technology.<br>

The platform focuses on rewarding **real-world behavior**, not online clicks, advertisements, or speculative activity. Eat2Earn is built to be simple, accessible, and sustainable, while gradually introducing ownership and ecosystem participation.
