# Eat to Earn ($EATT) Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction

Eat to Earn is a Web3 rewards platform built as a Telegram Mini App.  
Its goal is to turn everyday food purchases into on-chain rewards.

Instead of changing user behavior, Eat to Earn rewards what people already do: eat.

- App downloads

Users simply:
1. Eat at any restaurant  
2. Scan their bill inside Telegram  
3. Earn points and $EATT rewards
