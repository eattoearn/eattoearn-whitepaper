# What Is Eat2Earn?

**Eat2Earn** is a Telegram-native, real-world rewards platform designed to transform everyday food consumption into a gamified earning experience.

The product allows users to:

* Scan food bills
* Earn XP and points
* Progress through levels
* Participate in challenges
* Unlock future token utilities

All of this happens **inside Telegram**, without requiring a separate mobile app or technical onboarding.

***

### What Eat2Earn Is Not

To avoid confusion, it is important to clarify what Eat2Earn does **not** aim to be.

Eat2Earn is **not**:

* A food delivery app
* A restaurant discovery platform
* A discount or coupon marketplace
* A cashback application
* A speculative “tap-to-earn” game

Eat2Earn does not push restaurants, brands, or ads in its early phases.

The platform focuses on **rewarding behavior**, not redirecting behavior.

***

### Product Scope

Eat2Earn operates across three primary layers:

1. **Real-World Action Layer**
2. **Gamification & Progression Layer**
3. **Rewards & Ownership Layer**

Each layer is designed to build upon the previous one without forcing users into complexity.

***

### Real-World Action Layer

This layer captures and validates **real eating activity**.

Key characteristics:

* Works with any restaurant or food outlet
* Requires only a valid food bill
* No merchant integrations needed
* No brand restrictions

This ensures maximum coverage and minimal friction.

***

### Gamification & Progression Layer

The gamification layer transforms routine eating into an engaging experience.

It includes:

* XP accumulation
* Level progression
* Streak tracking
* Quests and challenges
* Badges and achievements

Gamification ensures that Eat2Earn remains engaging beyond initial novelty.

***

### Rewards & Ownership Layer

The rewards layer introduces long-term value.

Users earn:

* Points (reward weight)
* Early access benefits
* Priority unlocks

Future phases introduce:

* Token utilities
* Governance participation
* Ecosystem benefits

Ownership is introduced **gradually**, only after trust is established.

***

Eat2Earn is built for **years**, not hype cycles.

Each stage unlocks only when the ecosystem is ready.
