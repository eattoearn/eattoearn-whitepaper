# Token & Rewards Overview

The Eat2Earn ecosystem includes a future token designed to support utility, rewards, and governance. The token is **not required** to use the platform initially. Its role is to enable long-term participation and ecosystem alignment rather than speculation.

The token economy is structured to prioritize community rewards, ecosystem growth, and long-term stability. Insider advantages and short-term dumping incentives are intentionally avoided.\

he Eat2Earn token economy is designed to support long-term participation, fair distribution, and sustainable growth. The token is not the product itself, but an **extension of the reward and ownership layer** that aligns users, the ecosystem, and future partners.

From the beginning, the tokenomics model prioritizes **real usage over speculation**, ensuring that value flows to users who actively participate rather than to short-term actors.
