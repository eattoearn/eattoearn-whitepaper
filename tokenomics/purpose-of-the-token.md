# Purpose of the Token

The Eat2Earn token exists to represent participation value within the ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to enable:

* Reward distribution for verified real-world activity
* Utility access within the Eat2Earn ecosystem
* Long-term alignment between users and the platform
* Optional governance participation in later stages

Importantly, the token is **not required** to use Eat2Earn in its early phases. Users can earn XP and points without holding or interacting with any token, ensuring frictionless onboarding.
