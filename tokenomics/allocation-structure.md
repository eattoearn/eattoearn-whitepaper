# Allocation Structure

The token allocation is structured as follows:

**40% — Community Rewards**\
This portion is reserved for users who earn through real-world participation. Tokens from this pool are distributed gradually based on activity, points, and engagement over time.

**30% — Ecosystem Growth**\
Allocated to support partnerships, infrastructure, platform expansion, and long-term development. This allocation is managed transparently and released according to ecosystem needs.

**20% — Early User Allocation**\
Reserved for early participants who contribute during the foundational phases of Eat2Earn. This allocation is frozen initially and unlocks under predefined conditions to prevent unfair dilution.

**10% — Liquidity**\
Used to ensure healthy market conditions when token utilities are enabled. Liquidity is provisioned responsibly to avoid excessive volatility.
