# Vesting & Unlock Mechanics

Token releases follow a **time-based and activity-based vesting model**. There are no sudden unlocks designed to benefit insiders or short-term participants.

Early user allocations and ecosystem tokens are subject to lockups and gradual unlocks. This design protects long-term participants and ensures that token circulation reflects genuine platform maturity.

### Anti-Dump & Sustainability Measures

To maintain ecosystem stability, Eat2Earn incorporates multiple safeguards:

* No immediate large-scale unlocks
* Gradual emission aligned with usage growth
* Utility-driven demand rather than speculation
* Limited transferability during early phases

These measures reduce the risk of short-term price manipulation and encourage long-term alignment.

***

### Utility Before Speculation

The Eat2Earn token is introduced only when meaningful utility exists. Token usage is designed around participation, access, and contribution rather than passive holding.

Planned utilities may include:

* Reward redemption enhancements
* Access to premium challenges or events
* Participation in ecosystem decisions
* Long-term loyalty benefits

Speculative trading is not the focus of the token’s design.

### Governance (Future Phase)

Governance is introduced gradually and responsibly. Token-based governance, if enabled, will focus on ecosystem-level decisions such as feature prioritization, reward mechanics, and community initiatives.

Early governance participation will be limited to prevent manipulation and ensure informed decision-making.

***

### Long-Term Alignment

The Eat2Earn tokenomics model is built to align:

* Users who participate consistently
* The platform that enables rewards
* Partners who add value to the ecosystem

By tying ownership to real-world behavior, Eat2Earn creates a participation economy that grows organically and sustainably.
