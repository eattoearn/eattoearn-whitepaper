# Points vs Token Relationship

Eat2Earn separates **earning** from **ownership** through a two-layer system.

Points are earned through verified actions such as bill scanning, streak maintenance, and challenge completion. These points represent **reward weight and contribution**, not immediate financial value.

At a later stage, points influence token distribution and utility access. This approach ensures that token allocation reflects **real participation history**, not speculative activity or capital advantage.<br>

### Token Supply Philosophy

The total token supply is fixed and defined to avoid long-term inflation. The distribution model is intentionally conservative, focusing on gradual release aligned with ecosystem growth.

The token supply is allocated in a way that ensures:

* Community participants receive the largest share
* Early contributors are protected from dilution
* Ecosystem growth is sustainably funded
* Liquidity is sufficient but not extractive
