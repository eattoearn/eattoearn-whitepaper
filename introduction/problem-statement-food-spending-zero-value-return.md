# Problem statement (food spending, zero value return)

#### 1. Zero Value Return on Daily Spending

Food is one of the most frequent and unavoidable expenses in the world.\
Despite this, users receive:

* No ownership
* No progress
* No long-term benefit

Eat2Earn transforms daily food expenses into an opportunity to earn value.

***

#### 2. Broken Loyalty & Cashback Systems

Traditional food loyalty systems:

* Work only with specific merchants
* Offer low, delayed rewards
* Are heavily ad-driven
* Provide no sense of progression or ownership

Users are forced to change where they eat instead of being rewarded for eating normally.

Eat2Earn removes merchant lock-ins entirely.

***

#### 3. High Friction in Existing “Earn” Platforms

Many existing earn-based platforms suffer from:

* Complex onboarding
* Mandatory wallets
* High technical barriers
* Speculation-first design

Eat2Earn is designed to be **Web2-simple first**, with optional Web3 elements added progressively.
