# The Problem Eat2Earn Solves

Food is one of the most frequent and unavoidable expenses globally. Despite this, food spending produces no long-term benefit for consumers beyond the meal itself. Existing loyalty programs and cashback systems are fragmented, merchant-dependent, and offer low engagement value. Most users abandon them once incentives fade.

At the same time, many Web3 “earn” platforms failed due to high onboarding friction, wallet complexity, and reward farming that destroyed sustainability.

Eat2Earn addresses both problems by rewarding **existing daily behavior** through a frictionless, gamified system that does not require users to change where or how they eat.
