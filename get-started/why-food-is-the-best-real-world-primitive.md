# How Eat2Earn Works

Eat2Earn operates on a simple, intuitive flow. Users eat at any restaurant or food outlet of their choice and scan their food bill using the Eat2Earn Telegram Mini App. The system validates the bill and rewards the user with XP and points instantly.

XP reflects activity and consistency, while points represent long-term reward weight and future ecosystem participation. This approach ensures rewards are tied to real actions and discourages artificial engagement.
