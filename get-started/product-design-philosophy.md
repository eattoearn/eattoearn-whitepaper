# Product Design Philosophy

Eat2Earn is designed with a **Web2-first, Web3-ready** approach. Users can begin earning without wallets, tokens, or technical knowledge. Ownership and token utilities are introduced only after users understand the product and trust the system.

The product intentionally avoids pay-to-win mechanics, high-yield farming, and speculative shortcuts. Progress is earned through consistency and genuine participation rather than volume or manipulation.
