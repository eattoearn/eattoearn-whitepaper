# Gamification & User Engagement

To ensure long-term engagement, Eat2Earn incorporates a gamification layer built around progression and achievement. Users level up by earning XP, unlock multipliers through consistent activity, and participate in daily quests and streaks.

Badges, achievements, and leaderboards provide recognition and social motivation, transforming food consumption into an ongoing experience rather than a one-time reward action.
